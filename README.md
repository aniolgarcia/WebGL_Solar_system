# WebGL_Solar_system
My first version of a WebGL representation of our solar system. This is a dynamic model, so once you execute it, the planets 
will start to move if you press "x" or spcebar.

Obviously, this representation isn't accurate, so the velocities, orbits, sizes, moons, scales, distances and textures 
won't be correct.

At the moment, the comments in the code (and the code itself), are in Catalan, maybe them will be translated in the future...

Hope you enjoy it!
